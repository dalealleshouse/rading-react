## React Architecture

Why is State Management a larger concern in React than in other UI frameworks?
- React isn't a *framework*, it's a *library*
- In the absence of a canonical state management solution, developers must
    invent one.
    * Classic Freedom vs. Standards Debate

### Model-View-Intent

Example include Elm and Cycle.js.
Architecture of "well designed" React application.

 ![Model-View-Intent](mvi.png)

- Model - completely describes the state of the user interface. 
    * Total source of truth
- View - transforms the model into a user interface
    - at any moment, the UI can be generated from nothing but the model
- Intent - UI generated by View can produce intents. 

Conceptually a finite state machine
- Model represents all possible states
- Intents represent all possible transitions

#### Model-View-Intent Pseudo Code
```javascript
let model = {};

let view = (m) => <.../>;

let update = (model, intent) => new_model;
```

### State Container

Abstraction on top of Model-View-Intent that encapsulates the model and update
components.

Methods
- getState() - returns application state
- dispatch() - applies an intent to the state
- subscribe() - registers a callback to be called when the state changes
